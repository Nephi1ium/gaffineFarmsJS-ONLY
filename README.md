A website created to increase family connection, and encourage planning of family events. An added bonus is the ability to share memories accessible by all family members. Currently, the site is protected lightly by a client side password which, though it is not perfectly secure, accomplishes the task of protecting the page from accidental viewing by non family members. Future plans are to connect a cloud based storage vendor for uploading of images. Also in the works is a comments section for family announcements and updates. Snapchat integration of some sort is being considered.
